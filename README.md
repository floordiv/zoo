# Zoo
Zoo is administration tool, which helps you to handle with dozens of services should run.

You just write configuration file for every service once, and run it always without worries.

What can it purpose for you? Actually, it does the same, as, for example, tiny bash-script. BUT, bash-script won't let you to monitor service output, cool plugins-system, restart services after finishing by only one line in the config, it won't say you whether any your service is alive, or not!

Thanks to plugin system, all this is possible. Everything you need - just to have a client-side plugin (there is no need to install them on server, but if you want, you can write simple broadcast plugin on server :D). You can even monitor your services statuses in telegram bot! 

As a result, zoo - gives you flexibility in services' administration.
