How to: write service file for your service

Service file is a simple config of your service runner
Service file should has an extension ".service"
It has only one required field: "cmd".
This field contains a command (full command: it may contain any string),
with which one your service will be started.

See about .pack files below.

Non-required fields are just additional settings. There are such available fields:
  - name [string]: service's name
  - path [string]: executable file's path (. is default value; means that executable file in the
                                           same dir as .service file; ./ means that executable file
                                           is in the current ZOO PROCESS active directory)
  - autorestart [true/false]: whether service will be restarted after finishing. Disabled by default
  - restart_timeout [number]: autorestart timeout (in seconds; float accepted)
  - output_maxlines [number]: how much output's lines will be kept in memory


Service config syntax:
  string="any string"
  another_string = 'this is accepted, too'

  integer=1
  another_integer= -1

  float=1.5
  another_float= -1.5

  bool=true
  another_bool=false


[.pack files]
.pack file is a file, which contains paths to .service files (or even another .pack files)
.pack file syntax:
  path/to/service/file.service
  path/to/pack/file.pack
