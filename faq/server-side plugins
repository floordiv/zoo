Zoo - aloe-server based tool, so, it is really flexible for plugins.
Nowadays, Zoo server can show you active services, and their output.
But nobody can forbid you to write your own server-plugins for, as
example, server's cpu load, or something else. Or even broadcast server.
You can do everything you want with Zoo! How good, that this software
gives you this opportunity.
